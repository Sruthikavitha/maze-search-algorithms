# Maze Search Algorithms

This project implements BFS, DFS, and A* search algorithms to solve a maze.

## Input Format
Example:
S010,1010,000G

- S = Start
- G = Goal
- 1 = Wall
- 0 = Free path

## Algorithms Used
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- A* Search

## Visualization
Matplotlib is used to visualize the maze and paths.
